# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It uses CSS3, jQuery and HTML5. The page is designed responsively to accomodate use on desktops as well as tablets. Post tweets and see them update on the page in ascending order by the time they were posted. This website also contains a clickable new tweet button which reveals the form to show a new tweet and a button to bring you to the top of the page. Requests are made to the server via AJAX. It runs on <http://localhost:8080>.
